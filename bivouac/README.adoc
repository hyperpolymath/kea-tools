v1.0.0-draft.1, December 2025
:description: Orchestration and deployment controller for the Kea ecosystem.

== Purpose
The Bivouac is the strategic "Roost" where the Flock's actions are coordinated. It manages the **Separation of Administration from Runtime**, ensuring the "Wharf" remains invisible to the "Range."

== Features
* **Nomadic Deployment:** Uses `Resource-Record-Fluctuator` to rotate IP/DNS locations.
* **Playbook Execution:** Directly interprets `PLAYBOOK.scm` files to resolve incidents.
* **mTLS Integrity:** Enforces zero-trust communication between all satellites and Refugia.



== The "Wharf-to-Yacht" Model
The Bivouac (Wharf) never resides on the same network layer as the Range (Yacht). Communication is strictly outbound from the Bivouac via secure `Kea-Calls`.

== Usage
[source,bash]
----
# Execute a failover procedure defined in the Playbook
