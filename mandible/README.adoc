:description: High-dexterity investigative sensors for Kea.

== Purpose
Kea-Mandible provides the physical "reach" of the ecosystem. It is a prokinetic sensor suite designed to pry into filesystems, network configurations, and WordPress cores to identify instability and "Slop."

== Components
* **Kea-Beak:** The general-purpose Mercury-based system auditor.
* **WP-Praxis:** A specialized Rust-based auditor for WordPress environments.
* **Slop-Gate:** Actively rejects non-functional bloat in the runtime path.



== Performance
* **Throughput:** 10,000+ files per second.
* **Accuracy:** 99.9% via formal Mercury type-checks.
* **Output:** Encodes findings into `Kea-Call` (Cap'n Proto) format.

== Usage
[source,bash]
----
# Trigger a deep-audit of the runtime path
just pry --target=/var/www/html
